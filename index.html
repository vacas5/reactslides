                            They all seem to take this strategy of "let's build the plane while flying". Meaning, we have to do things in a hurry, often with little to no idea what we actually want to accomplish product-wise. Things change constantly. And in these type of situations, under these conditions, you have a tendency to pile up Technical Debt.

You might expect there to be bugs on an implementation of a new feature, but you don't build in time to fix regressions. They can also be very difficult to spot, and may only appear under a very specific set of circumstances that are tough to test for. They can really erode confidence in a dev team. Something about a regression makes management wonder what the hell we're all doing. A lot of times I stress or miss deadlines.</aside>

                            Yeah. This is kinda a biggie. Yes, there are things that I want to do. I've learned a lot and all those old patterns make my stomach queasy. But that doesn't make it technical debt. Tech debt is when you've made intentionally brittle/hacky choices in order to meet a deadline, and you know it can't scale and can't be allowed to stay like it is for long. Tech debt is a risk to your software and your team.

                        <aside class="notes">And here it is. This is what we're ultimately here for. To build great software. We should not lose focus on the goal. And I sympathize if you feel like the code base is your only domain. But it's not. We all can stay focused on making great software. Because great software equals users equals us still having jobs. I know it's not that simple, but we all own the finished product. Let's make sure the choices we make about the time we spend are making it better.</aside>

                            This is a really good but unfortunate example of technical debt. With most dependencies, you are choosing to rely on someone else's code in order to quickly achieve a goal. The pain of keeping them up to date is the payback. Relying on old or unsupported dependencies can really hamstring future development, so yes I think it's worth the effort to try and keep these up to date, or better yet, refactor out completely ones you don't need anymore.

                            There are a few reasons why you would might to do this. Todd Motto has a good article on it. But what would my answer be? No. This is a good example of adopting a new, arguably better pattern. However, the old pattern worked just fine, if less extensible. Dropping everything to change every switch in the code base would take up too much effort. Maybe I could refactor as I go along.

However, it doesn't have to cause a lot of work for us. We can continue to use the same terminology in the front end and just assign the new name to it. What should I do? I say refactor, although it is certainly not without real risk of regression. But by leaving it inconsistent when it comes to something like your data model, you are relying on tribal knowledge to remember what means what, unless you really want to explain the difference in documentation somewhere. Yes this has happened to me.</aside>

We'll definitley be pushing this to next sprint. -- So, a lot of times this is the temptation but I would encourage you to seek first to redo the view without a complete rewrite. Your old view probably contains a lot of tribal knowledge in it that even product people and designers have forgotten. Be wary!</aside>

                            borrowed this image from MDN. JS is what is known as a �single threaded� which basically means one thing at a time. As your JS is run, it handles one function at a time in the order in which they are called. It creates a LIFO stack of these called the call stack. While it is processing these things in order, the browser is effectively blocked (repaints, etc).
The task queue is another queue used by the browser to keep track of things that need to be executed. It is separate from the call stack. These are handled in the order in which they come in. Event loop waits on the stack to clear and then adds from the queue.
